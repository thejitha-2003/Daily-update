1. What is JavaScript and how does it differ from Java?
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web
 pages interactive.
Java is a compiled, object-oriented programming language used for large applications.

Difference

JavaScript       	Java

Interpreted     	Compiled
Dynamic typing  	Static typing
Runs in browser	     Runs on JVM
Used for frontend	 Used for backend & Android

Example

console.log("Hello JavaScript");


Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types
Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the built-in data types provided by JavaScript. 
They represent single values and are not mutable.the primitive data types are:
string, number, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, symbol
let num = 10;             // primitive

Non-primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types
They can store collections of values or more complex entities.The non-primitive Data types are
Objects (arrays, functions, dates, etc.)
let user = { name: "Ram" } // non-primitive


3. Difference between var, let, const
1. Scope

var → Function Scoped

It is accessible anywhere inside the function in which it is declared.

let → Block Scoped

It is accessible only inside the { } block where it is declared.

const → Block Scoped
Same as let, but the value cannot be reassigned.

Example:

if (true) {
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

console.log(a); // 10 (function/global scope)
console.log(b); // Error (block scope)
console.log(c); // Error (block scope)

2.Hoisting Behavior

 var → Hoisted with undefined

 let → Hoisted but in TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone), so gives error

 const → Same as let (in TDZ)

Example:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // Error (TDZ)
let b = 20;

console.log(c); // Error (TDZ)
const c = 30;

4.What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are
 moved to the top before execution.

 Example

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

Hoisting differ for var and let ,const

 var → Hoisted with undefined

 let → Hoisted but in TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone), so gives error

 const → Same as let (in TDZ)

Example:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // Error (TDZ)
let b = 20;

console.log(c); // Error (TDZ)
const c = 30;

5.Difference Between == and === in JavaScript
1. == (Loose Equality / Abstract Equality)

Definition
== compares only values, and if the types are different,
 JavaScript performs type coercion (automatic conversion).

Example
5 == "5"     // true  (string "5" converted to number 5)
0 == false   // true
null == undefined // true

2. === (Strict Equality)

Definition
=== compares both value AND type.
No type conversion happens.

Example
5 === "5"    // false (number vs string)
0 === false  // false (number vs boolean)
null === undefined // false

6.Truthy and Falsy Values
Falsy Values (VERY IMPORTANT)

A falsy value is a value that becomes false when converted to a boolean.

JavaScript has ONLY 7 falsy values:

1. false
2. 0
3. -0
4. 0n (BigInt zero)
5. "" (empty string)
6. null
7. undefined
8. NaN
 Any of these values, when checked in if(), become false.

Examples
if (0) console.log("Yes");  // no output
if ("") console.log("Yes"); // no output
if (null) console.log("Yes"); // no output

Truthy Values

A truthy value is a value that becomes true when converted to a boolean.
 Everything in JavaScript is truthy except the falsy values above.

Common truthy examples:

1."hello" (non-empty string)
2." " (space string)
3.1
4.-1
5.[] (empty array)
6.{} (empty object)
7.function(){}
8.true

Examples

if ("hello") console.log("Yes"); // Yes
if ([]) console.log("Yes");      // Yes
if ({}) console.log("Yes");      // Yes

7.Use of typeOf operator
The typeof operator in JavaScript is used to find the data type of a value or variable.
typeof is an operator that returns a string describing the type of the value.
Syntax:
typeof value
Examples

1.Check number
console.log(typeof 10); // "number"

2.Check string
console.log(typeof "Hello");// "string"

3.Check boolean
console.log(typeof true);// "boolean"

4.Check undefined
let a;
console.log(typeof a);// "undefined"

5. Check object
console.log(typeof { name: "Aman" });// "object"

6. Check array
console.log(typeof [1,2,3]);// "object"  

7. Check function
console.log(typeof function(){});// "function"



8. What is NaN and how can you check for it?

Definition 
NaN (Not-a-Number) represents a value that is not a valid number.It is of type number, 
even though it means “not a number”.It is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.
Example
console.log(Number.isNaN(0 / 0));   // true
console.log(Number.isNaN("abc"));   // false
console.log(isNaN("abc"));          // true (coerced to NaN)


9. What is the difference between undefined and null?
undefined
A variable that is declared but not assigned gets undefined.
JavaScript automatically assigns this value.
Type of undefined is "undefined".


null
null is a deliberately assigned empty value.
It is used to show “no value intentionally”.
Type of null is "object" (a historical JS bug).


Example
let a;
console.log(a);     // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b);     // null


0. What is type coercion in JavaScript?

Definition 
Type coercion is the process where JavaScript automatically converts one data type into another.
It can be implicit (JS does it automatically) or explicit (developer converts manually).
Common conversions involve string <->number, boolean <->number, etc.
Examples
Implicit
console.log(5 + "3");   // "53"
console.log("6" * 2);   // 12

Explicit
console.log(Number("42"));   // 42
console.log(String(100));    // "100"


11. Explain global scope, function scope, and block scope
Definition 
Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block and are accessible 
everywhere in the program.
Function Scope: Variables declared inside a function can be accessed only within that function.
Block Scope: Variables declared inside {} using let or const are accessible only inside that block.

Example
let g = "global";   // global scope
function test() {
  let f = "function";   // function scope
  if (true) {
    let b = "block";    // block scope
  }
}


2. How does hoisting work for variables and functions?

Definition 
Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
Function declarations are fully hoisted (you can call them before defining).
var declarations are hoisted but initialized as undefined.
let/const declarations are hoisted but stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until execution.

Example
hello();   // Works
function hello() { console.log("Hi"); }

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // error
let b = 20;


13. What happens if you use a variable before declaring it?
Definition 
Using a var variable before declaration gives undefined because of hoisting.
Using let/const before declaration gives a ReferenceError due to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).


Example

console.log(x);  // undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y);  // ReferenceError
let y = 10;


14. What is lexical scope?

Definition 

Lexical scope means a variable is accessible based on where it is written in the code.

Inner functions can access variables from outer functions, but not vice-versa.


Example

function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);   // can access a
  }
  inner();
}

15. How do closures work in JavaScript?

Definition 

A closure is created when an inner function remembers and accesses variables from its outer function even after the outer function has returned.

Used for data privacy, function factories, etc.


Example

function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const inc = outer();
inc(); // 1
inc(); // 2


16. What is the difference between var, let, and const in terms of hoisting?

Definition 

var: Hoisted and initialized with undefined.

let: Hoisted but stays in Temporal Dead Zone → using it early gives error.

const: Same as let, but must be initialized at declaration.


Example

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // error
let b = 20;

console.log(c); // error
const c = 30;


17. What are Temporal Dead Zones (TDZ)?

Definition 

TDZ is the time between hoisting and the actual initialization.

Variables declared with let/const exist but cannot be accessed in TDZ.

Accessing them before initialization throws a ReferenceError.


Example

console.log(x); // ReferenceError
let x = 10;


18. What are Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)?

Definition (with important points)

An IIFE is a function that is defined and executed immediately.

Used to create a private scope and avoid polluting global variables.


Example

(function () {
  console.log("IIFE executed");
})();

Great! Here are questions 19–30, answered in the same structure:

✔ Definition with important points included
✔ Then example


---

✅ 19. What is a pure function?

Definition (with important points)

A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input.

It does not modify external state (no side effects).

It depends only on its arguments.


Example

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;   // pure
}



 20. What is a higher-order function?

Definition 

A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument
OR returns a function.

Used in callbacks, functional programming, array methods etc.


Example

function greet(fn) {
  fn();   // accepting a function
}
greet(() => console.log("Hello"));




 21. What is a callback function?

Definition 

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.

It is executed after the main function finishes.

Common in asynchronous operations.


Example

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback executed");
}, 1000);

 22. What are arrow functions and how are they different from normal functions?

Definition 

Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions.

They do not have their own this, arguments, or prototype.

They cannot be used as constructors.


Example

const add = (a, b) => a + b;



23. What is the value of this inside an arrow function?

Definition 
Arrow functions use lexical this, meaning they inherit this from their surrounding scope.

They do NOT bind their own this.


Example

const obj = {
  a: 10,
  show: () => console.log(this.a)  // this is NOT obj
};
obj.show();  // undefined




24. What is function currying?

Definition 

Currying transforms a function so it takes one argument at a time.

It returns another function until all arguments are provided.

Used in functional programming and reuse.


Example

function curry(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}
console.log(curry(5)(3));  // 8


---

25. What is the difference between call, apply, and bind?

Definition 

call: Invokes a function immediately with a specific this and comma-separated arguments.

apply: Same as call, but arguments are passed as array.

bind: Returns a new function with a fixed this, does NOT execute immediately.


Example

function greet(msg) { console.log(msg + this.name); }

greet.call({name: "Bob"}, "Hi ");  
greet.apply({name: "Bob"}, ["Hi "]);  
const fn = greet.bind({name: "Bob"}, "Hi ");
fn();




26. How do you pass parameters by reference vs value?

Definition (with important points)

Primitive types (number, string, boolean, etc.) are passed by value → copy is passed.

Objects & arrays are passed by reference → changes affect original object.


Example

let a = 10;
let b = a;   // value copy
b = 20;

let obj = {x: 1};
let obj2 = obj;  // reference
obj2.x = 5;


27. What are default parameters in ES6?

Definition (with important points)

Default parameters allow you to assign default values to function parameters.

Used when arguments are missing or undefined.


Example

function greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}
greet();    // Hello Guest



28. What is recursion in JavaScript?

Definition (with important points)

Recursion is when a function calls itself.

Used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller sub-problems.

Must have a base condition to avoid infinite loop.


Example

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


---

 29. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?

Definition 

Function Declaration: Defined using the function keyword and fully hoisted.

Function Expression: Assigned to a variable and not fully hoisted.


Example

hello();  // works
function hello() {}

hi();     // error
const hi = function() {};



30. What is a generator function?

Definition

A generator function is declared using function* and can pause and resume execution.

Uses the yield keyword to return values one at a time.

Returns a generator object with a next() method.


Example

function* gen() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
}
const g = gen();
console.log(g.next());  // {value: 1, done: false}
